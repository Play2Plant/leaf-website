# Design patterns used

* The LEAF token contract inherits the OpenZeppelin ERC20 and ERC20Burnable contracts for the use of the ERC20 standard functions and the burn option.
* The NFT Leaf contract inherits the OpenZeppelin contracts ERC721, Ownable, Strings, ERC721Enumerable and it also inherits ERC2981PerTokenRoyalties.
